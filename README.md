# Title: To Alter the World!

## Description

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to To Alter the World! A comprehensive website dedicated to exploring the world of geometric transformations in math, including translation, rotation, and dilation. Here, you will find concise explanations, visual guides, and our ultimate interactive graphing model, allowing you to be visually familiar with the different transformations and understand how they work in geometry and beyond.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether youâ€™re a student learning and looking to grasp the basics or a mathematical enthusiast diving deeper into geometric transformations, To Alter the World offers a learning experience that is both approachable and engaging! With our resources, you will gain a solid foundation in these essential topics. Start exploring our playground today to transform your understanding of math!

## Javascript:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javascript will be used in the main page mainly through first, the effects in the title area. The title box will have a 3D model in the background which will be controlled by JS. Second, there will be many canvas objects throught the website, including the main page, that illustrate certain aspects of the topic. The shapes drawn in these areas will be controlled by JS. (An example of this is already shown in the current website) Finally, there could be various forms in the website for customer satisfaction, surveys, and possibly quizzes on the topic. These quizzes will be graded and recorde by JS.

## Outline:

### Graph of Recomended Viewing of Pages

(every page can be accessed from every other page, this is just now the website is intened to be traversed)

### Key and Explanations of each Page

- M (main page)
  - The main page will consist of a title, introduction, and sample animations regarding transformations. The introduction would contain the definition of mathematical transformations and details on what users will learn throught he website. At the end will be a button to teleport to the page select part of the website. At the top will be a bar that only appears when the cursor is placed near the top area of the page. It will contain links to all the other pages of the website plus the website and company logo. (If we have time, we might be able to make a company website as well :3)
- 0 (page select)
  - The page select will contain the links to all of the content pages. The links will be beside visuals that give a glimpse about what the topic being discussed is about. Moreover, there will be a short description beside each button on what each lesson teaches.
- 1-n (content pages, the graph shows three)
  - Each of the content pages will contain text explaining the specific transformation being discussed, canvas objects that the user can interact with that demostrate the concepts, and questions/queries that will be shown to the user to confirm that they follow with the lesson. Moreover, there will be a summary at the bottom of the page with the important formulas and takeaways from each page. Some quiz questions or sample questions could also be contained in this area. These pages will have the same upper bar of the other pages and will also have a quick shortcut to the next topic at the very bottom.
- E (last page possibly containing a quiz and a sandbox for transformations)
  - This page is planned to contain two main things. The first is a quiz about all of the topics discussed in the previous lessons. After answering, the website, aside from showing the score, could also show the weak and strong points of the user and which topics they need to work on more. The second thing that may be in this page is a sandbox. This is mainly to let the user play around with the lessons that were taught. The sample canvas object in the prototype website right now is a preview of what the sandbox may be like, albeit rudementary.
- C (credits page)
  - The credits page will mainly contain the information about the authors, the sources that were used to make the main content of the website, websites that were of inspiration in making the website, the sources of the assets (such as photos, 3D models, etc.) that were used in the website, and finally micallaneous sources that could have been used for inspiration or other things.

### Plans

2nd Quarter: Main Page & Page Selection

Christmas Break: Planning for Content and Order of lesson Pages (could start with lesson page implementation)

3rd Quarter: Implementation of the Lesson Pages + End Page

Mid Quarter Break: Credits Page Start

4th Quarter: Credits page + Playtesters + Bugfixing + Better Design

### Notes

If you've made it this far, you deserve to know that before this idea, our original idea was a page dedicated to dementia and would kind of simulate it by the test and web-page deteriorating the more the user scrolled. However, this idea was scrapped because it proved to demanding on artistic skill and lacking in terms of JS application.
